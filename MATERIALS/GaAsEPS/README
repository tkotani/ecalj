1. make convergence by 'lmf gaas'.
>mpirun -np $NUM_PROCS lmf-MPIK gd >& lmf.out

2. run epsPP_lmfh
>epsPP_lmfh -np 6 gaas >& epsPP.out

3.
For imaginary part of eps, 
>gnuplot -p epsplot.glt

Be careful. At the threshold, 
we must have \sqrt(E-Egap) behevior. 
However, we don't see it --- this is numerical problem of our technique.
(I need special technique to recover the \sqrt(E) behevior).
