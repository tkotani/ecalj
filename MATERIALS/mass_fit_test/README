Effective Mass fitting test for ZB structure.
===================================================

For test,
run 
./job 
---> console output is given in 'out' file.

./job contains
------------
python2 ./jobprepare.py >jobbash;bash jobbash
python2 ./job_mass.py
------------

Here, jobbash should be
=========================================
echo -----------  CdS_so.qsgw.mass
pushd .
cd CdS_so.qsgw.mass
cp ../syml.init syml.cds
~/bin/job_band cds -np 24 -vnspin=2 -vso=1 NoGnuplot
popd
echo -----------  GaAs_so.qsgw.mass
pushd .
cd GaAs_so.qsgw.mass
cp ../syml.init syml.gaas
~/bin/job_band gaas -np 24 -vnspin=2 -vso=1 NoGnuplot
popd
echo -----------  GaNzb_so.qsgw.mass
pushd .
cd GaNzb_so.qsgw.mass
cp ../syml.init syml.ganzb
~/bin/job_band ganzb -np 24 -vnspin=2 -vso=1 NoGnuplot
popd
=========================================
Look into jobprepare.py. At all directories with *.mass,
we go into them and run job_band, as shown in the above jobbash script.
See special lies in syml.init
----------------
-888 !note -888 start Mass line. Here is a ZB case
1025  0 0 0   .5 .5  .5   1  512     0.1 0.01    Gamma  L
1025  0 0 0    1.  0  0   1  512     0.1 0.01    Gamma  X
1025  0 0 0   .75 .75 0   1  512     0.1 0.01    Gamma  K
---------------
First line means 1025 divisions between (0 0 0)-(0.5,0.5,0.5).
And calcualte eigenvalues 
from 1 to 512 (thus just up to (0.25 0.25 0.25) in this case).
"0.1 0.01" means tolerance for what bands we show; range is 
[VBM-0.1 VBM] and [CBM CBM+0.01].


Then we run
   job_mass.py
to calculate effective mass.(look into job_mass.py)
It determines effective mass for ZB semiconductors along symmetry lines 
and branches.
    for di  in ['111', '100', '110']:    --> symmetry lines
        ...
and branches for
        for mxx  in ['mso', 'mlh', 'mhh', 'mee']: --> splitoff band, light hole, heavy hole, electron mass.
.

Finally it shows line such as
mmm3: CdS_so.qsgw.mass_mso100 mass=  0.348  0.348; E0(eV)=  -0.26  -0.26
This means
  mass_so is m/me=0.348 (two lines are gdegenerated).

As JOBmassfit.glt shows,
formula='   q**2/(2*mass)=(E*(1+E/E0))*ry/2, where E in eV ry=13.605'
is used for mass fitting. Thus linear behevior for E \gtsim E0 is assumed.
We do least square fit for mass and E0.

Be careful.
Along 100, we can determine E0 and mass uniquely but not along another lines.
This is reasonable from theoretical point of view.
