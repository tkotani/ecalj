need to add more band plot, dos (especially pdos) samples...

---
GW samples are in fpgw/TESTinstallGW or so.

---
Many samples are now generated by ctrlgen2.py from ctrls.* (structure
file). Its ctrl files are in PMT=LMTO+LAPW method. We virtually do not
need to be bothered with the setting of MTOs paremeter.
However, QSGW(quasiparticle self-consistent GW) is only for MTO basis
(one-shot GW works for PMT).
In such a case, you need to set up MTO basis with the knowledge of the
PMT method...

Empty did not work (free band plot). If required, need to fix it.

===Structure relaxation ===
Structure relaxiation tests, eg, H2O, H2O_2, and LaGaO3.
Do job and jobrelaxation successively.
(look into them. Check the diffence of ctrl files.)

Final position is seen in at the end of log.h2o file. 
(also included in rst.h2o file--->
 this may be a little problematic since structure can be taken from rst
 file when we restart calculations from some rst file). 

Watch tail of samve.h2o, e.g, 'tail -f save.h2o' if you do jobrelaxation >& output or so.
Do 'grep Harris output'.
Do lmf --help to set where we read structure.

ctrlgen2.py gives relatively safe ctrl file. It can mean some
inefficiency. You can speed it up by using
limited number of basis (e.g, 13 basis per and and pwe=2).

Considering the stability of the Hohenberg-Kohn energy ehk=, rather
than Harris-Foulkner energy ehh=, we may have room to accelerate
convergence when atoms are moving.

A possible choice may be to use FRZWF=T (phi,phidot,philocalorbital fixed).
This can be good since our standard size of MT is rather small.
