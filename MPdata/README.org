This is to take file from Material project and perform LDA level calculations.

#---------------------------
step 1.
>Run mpqueryALL.py 
Get data from mp. Change nxx and GetPOSOCAR
as you like. All POSCAR is is POSCARALL/

step 2.



Example
>job_mp 148 149 150 |& tee out |grep OK 

This performs 
1. Get POSCAR of mp-148 from Material project
2. Convert POSCAR to ctrl file
3. lmfa and lmf-MPIK
4. getsyml to get syml.* file
5. job_band 
6. job_tdos.

Finally, we have 
mp-148/
mp-149/
mp-150/
In these directories, we have LDA results.
*.eps contains dos and band plot.
Check save.* files for convergence.
