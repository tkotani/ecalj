         The felz test computes the orbital moment in Fe.
         lmf calculates the orbital magnetic moment.

           * In the first part of this test only LzSz is used.
        
           * The APW basis with LzSz is also checked.

	   * In the second part the FULL SPIN ORBIT is used.

           * Symmetry operations must be suppressed at present.

           * Only 4x4x4 k points are used in this test.
