Get symmetry line. syml.* from ctrl.*

In this directory, we have getsyml.py, which is based on the
seekpath(v.1.2.0, dec2016). https://github.com/giovannipizzi/seekpath/


===========================
Requirement and Install:

1.seekpath
>git clone https://github.com/giovannipizzi/seekpath/
>python setup.py install --user

2.matplotlib for 3D plot
> python -m pip install --update pip  #pip update
> pip install matplotlib

3.spglib for crystal structure symmetry
>git clone https://github.com/atztogo/spglib.git
>python setup.py install --user
--user install it locally.


===========================
Usage: (we use python2. I don't know python3 works or not)
>python getsyml.py nio
>python getsyml.py ctrls.nio 
This show 3D Brillouin zone together with symmetry line for band plot.
The symmetry lines are written into the syml.* file.
You can edit syml.* for bandplot by the job_band command.
The number of divisions for syml is give by simple algorism, so edit
it if necessary.


===========================
Citations when we use.
  In addition to usual ecalj acknowledgement, folllowing citations are
  required when you use getsyml.py.

   1.Y. Hinuma, G. Pizzi, Y. Kumagai, F. Oba, I. Tanaka, 
     Band structure diagram paths based on crystallography,
     Comp. Mat. Sci. 128, 140 (2017) 
   2.You should also cite spglib that is an essential library used in the implementation.

See Lincence.txt for spglib and seekpath.

TODO:
   a.Modify lmchk to write required information to supply reasonable.
     For example, ndiv (mesh size along lines).
   b.Numerical accuracy of calculations. 
     np.set_printoptions(precision=16) is not meaningful since we read
     output of lmchk
