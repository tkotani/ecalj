In q48, we prepared more detailed calculations.
Calculation parameters below:

MLWF:
n1n2n3 = 4 4 4
      maybe rough because "ni9_fbband.eps" shows some Wannier bands deviate from the original band structure (presented by gray color).

Magnon:
n1n2n3 = 48 48 48
       There are 24+1 devided points along Gamma-X.
