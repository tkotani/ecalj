         The cdte test illustrates the LDA+U implementation in various modes:

         It begins with a self-consistent LDA+U calculation with U=4 eV on Cd d, FLL limit.
         The main effects are:
           * to push down the Cd d levels by 2 eV relative to the LDA
           * reduce total energy is about 20mRy less binding relative to LDA (-0.389970 Ry)
             (there is presumably a corresponding shift in the free atom energy, but
             no attempt was made to calculate it)
           * increase the bandgap by 0.1 eV relative to LDA (0.52 eV) to 0.62 eV

         Starting from this density and density-matrix, three one-shot calculations are performed.

         1. A potential shift -2 eV on Cd d (IDU=4) is used in place of U=4 eV.
            The test verifies that both the total energy and the bandgap are unchanged,
            and that the density is almost self-consistent.

         2. An additional potential shift +1 eV on Cd s (IDU=4) is included.
            It has the effect of increasing the gap to 0.99 eV, and reducing the energy by 70 mRy.
            Ueff is determined to be 0.337 Ry to generate this potential shift.
            (Note that this pass somewhat reduces the Cd s density-matrix)

         3. A normal LDA+U is included on the Cd s orbital, U=0.337 in the FLL.
            The test verifies that the gap, small change in output density, and EHK
            are essentially identical to the results of test 2.
