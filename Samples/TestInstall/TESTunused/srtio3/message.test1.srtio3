         The srtio3 test also illustrates the following:

         1.  how to freeze augmented wave functions for a particular
             species (cf token FRZWF=t for species Sr).

         2.  local orbitals (Sr 4p and Ti 4p are included as local orbitals)
             
         3.  extended local orbitals
             (last step recalculated with extended Sr 4p and Ti 4p local orbitals)
             
         4.  APW addition to basis

         5.  Renormalized free O atom for better starting density

         6.  use of restart file with shifted atom positions
