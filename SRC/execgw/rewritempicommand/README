E.g., for gwsc

This directory contains gwsc.ref, which is made by 'gawk -f makeref gwsc > gwsc.ref'.
You can change ref2cmd.awk to make a new 'gwsc script', by 'gawk -f ref2cmd.awk gwsc.ref > gwsc.new'

gwsc.ref contains %CMD lines. Based on that line, ref2cmd.awk generates executable lines.

For example,
%CMD mpi=1 program=lmf-MPIK target=$TARGET output=llmf 
->
mpirun -np $MPI_SIZE $nfpgw/lmf-MPIK  $TARGET > llmf 
  if ( $? != 0 )  then
    echo Error in 'lmf-MPIK ' output='llmf'
    exit 10
  endif
