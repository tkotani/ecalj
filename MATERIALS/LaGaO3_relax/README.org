* Sample of Relaxiation for LaGaO3

>mpirun -np 4 lmf-MPIK lagao3 >& output

See 
save.lagao3.
and 
force.dat, which is 'grep force output |grep Max'

CAUTION! Atomic position
AtomPos.* is written when DYN_MODE/=0
If AtomPos.* exist, we read atom position at the end of AtomPos.*
Now, we don't write atomic position in rst file.

-----
comment of this sample,

After several iteration, 
grep 'c ' save.lagao3 shows that the total energy (ehf or ehk) do not show improvements
by iteration. Forces are small enough (within ~a few mRy/a.u.)
So I think (not checked) that atomic positions are just fluctuating after 
several iterations. In other words, numerical accuracy is not so good 
enouth go atttain XTOL=0.001 a.u. Need check.
