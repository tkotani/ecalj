         Case cr3si6: a hexagonal environment with several atoms, two classes
         Other checks:
         verbose output, insulator, forces(mode 1)

         --- Test 1.  Basic check of programs lmfa,lmf ---
         Checks that program lmfa produces a sensible atm file
         and that program lmf iterates to the proper energy.

         The cr3si6 test also checks and illustrates the following:

         1.  insulator

         2.  forces with correction mode 1 (FORCES=1)

         3.  verbose output

         4.  A case with low kmxa (kmxa=2)
