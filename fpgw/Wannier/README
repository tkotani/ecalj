=============================================================
Maximally localized Wannier function generator, 
RPA and cRPA;
Apr2015
=============================================================

INSTALL: 
(This is a part of automatic installer such as ecalj/Install.ifort) 
After you do make at fpge/exec/, 
>make 
>make install
This copys binaries to your bin. 
In advance, look at Makefile first (set compilar, library and your bin).

--------------
>genMLWF 
is the script to generate Wanneir function.
Required setting is written in the GWinput file.
--------
We have several samples for genMLWF
Samples are:
 ecalj/MATERIALS/CuMLWFs    n1n2n3 4 4 4, rough but small within ~five minutes.
 ecalj/MATERIALS/CuMLWF     n1n2n3 10 10 10  
 ecalj/MATERIALS/SrVO3MLF
 ecalj/MATERIALS/FeMLWF
 ecalj/MATERIALS/NiOMLWF
 ecalj/MATERIALS/Ni
. 

-----------------------------
How to run samples?
-----------------------------
At first, run job_band for reference
(need syml.*)
>job_band cu -np 12
, where 12 means number of cores.
This gives correct Fermi energy, and stored into bnds.* file
It is read by hmaxloc, called from genMLWF.
Then run
>genMLWF -np 12 cu
where 12 is cores.

(1) Then look into ecalj/MATERIALS/CuMLWFs/bnds.gnu.cu.figMLWF
    This is for interpolated band.
(2) Plot psi.xsf file. 
    This contains MaxLoc Wannier function. (not necessary; you can
    comment out "wanplot" line if you don't need to plot Wannier.)
(3) grep Wan lwmat*
    This gives the matrix element of the Coulomb interaction and W-v.
    (off-diagonal elments are also calculated. Sorry, I have not yet
    document how to read this...)

== NOTE for setting orbitals for Wannier ===
 For the setting of the Wannier functions, you can use
 <Worb>...</Worb> section as
---------------
<Worb> Site 
  2 Fe    7 6 8 9 5
  3 Fe    7 6 8 9 5
</Worb> 
---------------
, instead of <MLWF>...</MLWF> setion used in the GWinput in the samples.
Note that the first column and second  column show the atomic site
index shown by lmchk.

=== NOTE for symmetric Wannier orbital. ===
If you like a set of Wannier orbitals keeping the crystal
symmetries, set 
------------------
wan_maxit_2nd 0
------------------
in GWinput. This set nsc2=0 in hmaxloc.F.
(The Marizari's 2nd step is skipped. Only the projection after Souza's
first step).


=== How to make? ====
for bash, type
>cat ../../InstallAll.gfortran
this shows MATH variable. Then set $MATH as enviaromental variable 
>MATH='/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfftw3.so.3 /usr/lib/liblapack.so.3gf /usr/lib/libblas.so.3gf'
and then run make as
>make PLATFORM=gfortran LIBMATH="$MATH"
This is also given in ../../InstallAll.gfortran



==============================
Known bugs:
 * Range of plot looks not good;
   Especially, vis_wan_ubound, vis_wan_lbound should be not integer.
   Probably, need to improve/(bug fix) wanplot.F.
 * xsf is special for Xcrysden, thus it is sometimes inconvenient. 
   You need to use GUI of Xcrysden. 
   But I have not tested no other format.

==============================
History:
2009; maxloc090910 (T.Miyake)
2009; Its documentation and Visualizer at Kino's https://github.com/nim-hrkn/visualize
2014Aug; T.Kotani modified it so as to fit to latest ecalj.
2015jan: Sengwoo Jang's modification.
2015apr: Sengwoo's RPAWannierTable.py.

=====================================================================
To plot U, J parameters.

1) Run genMLWF
   Please look into this script.
   (originally at fpgw/Wannier/genMLWF and copied to your $BINDIR when you
   did InstallAll.ifort).
   This is made from two stages. 
   >argin=2; run_arg $argin $NO_MPI $nfpgw /hmaxloc lmaxloc2
   (equilavent to echo 2| hmaxloc >lmaxloc2)
   is the end of Wannier function generation.

   At this point, you can make plot to check wether your setting for
   Wannier clearly truncate the model-Hilbert space by band plot.
   (we need syml.* file and run job_band to get original energy band
   Then plot wannier band on top of it. See
   MATERIALS/CuMLWFs/bnds.gnu.cu.figMLWF as an example.
   
`   If the plot is strange, you need to choose windows for Wannier.
   (Repeat echo 2| hmaxloc >lmaxloc2 until you have satisfactry
    fitting with changing the setting wannier part in GWinput ).

2) Run RPAWannierTable.py
    (This read
       nwf : number of Wannier function
       ns : 2 for Spin_polar calculation, 1 for Non spin_polar calculation
     from LMTO and GWinput.)

  In this script, "W*****.dat = Coulomb_v + Screening_W-v" files are
  generated. Calculate sum of v (in Coulmb_v)  and  W-v (in Screening W-v).
  In other words, all matrix elements of W are generated.
  For example, "W11234.dat" file contains "Spin up, <12|W|34> element".
  "W21234.dat" file contains "Spin down, <12|W|34> element".

  Then we have Static_W.dat (RPA) and Static_U.dat (cRPA)
  These contains static U, U', J, and J' (\omega = 0).

------------
NOTE: 
For practical calculations, we need to stop right after a line
>argin=2; run_arg $argin $NO_MPI $nfpgw /hmaxloc lmaxloc2  
in the genMLWF. 
(Need to modify genMLWF by hand; 
note that "run_arg" is a special subrouitne of bash. 
This line is equivalent to  >echo 2| hmaxloc >& lmaxloc2)
Then we need to check the band plot, with superposing Wannier band
"bnds.maxloc.up" u ($5):($6).
If the Wannier band is not reasonable, change settings of inner and outer windows,
and run >echo 2| hmaxloc |tee lmaxloc2
again and again until you have a reasonable Wannier band plot.
Then go ahead to the next steps (you may use genMLWF2).

-----------
NOTE: genMLWF  
      I added the "grep" commands in the last part of genMLWF to make
      three files containing v and W-v information.
          grep "Wannier" lwmatK1 > Coulomb_v
          grep "Wannier" lwmatK2 > Screening_W-v
          grep "Wannier" lwmatK3 > Screening_W-v_crpa

      hwmatK_MPI.F
         print all matrix elements of W and frequency in eV. called in genMLWF

--------------
CAUTION:
you must run job_band in advance to genMLWF!
If not you may need to follow instruction of "Efermi shift" as
follows;

NOTE: Efermi shift:
 genMLWF requies bnds.${target} to read the Fermi energy.
 To generate it, we need to run job_band in advance.
 Or run, 
 >echo 2 | /home/usr2/h70252a/binb46f/hmaxloc  > lmaxloc2
 (need syml*); this can be runned after genMLWF.
----
(Or need to shift Ef by hand as follows in gnuplot script.)
 ----------------------------------------------------
 de = ((ef shown in "lmaxloc2") - (ef in llmf_ef(bnds.${target}))*13.605
 plot \
 "bnd1.dat" u 2:3 lt 1 pt 1 not w l,\
 "bnd2.dat" u 2:3 lt 1 pt 1 not w l,\
 "bnd3.dat" u 2:3 lt 1 pt 1 not w l,\
 "bnd4.dat" u 2:3 lt 1 pt 1 not w l,\
 "bnd5.dat" u 2:3 lt 1 pt 1 not w l,\
 "bnds.maxloc.up" u ($5):($6+de) lt 3 w l ti "Wannier"
