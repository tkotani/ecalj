=== Dimer and atom calculations in supercell. ===

We can generates job scipcts and required ctrl files by
  >make_job --bg
  >make_job --pjsub  !for pj subsystem
  >make_job --bg --nrel
  >make_job --pjsub --nrel

Extentions .nrel. means non-relativistic cases.
Please look into make_jobque.* files at first.
These generate TEST.bg/ or TEST.pjsub/, where we have scripts
 jobque.bg or jobque.pjsub.

TEST.atom.bg and so on are files for atom.

You can start all calculations with 
  >bash jobque
, and so on, in principle (however, it can be a very expensive job).
Look into jobdimerlist.15, which specify dimers (or atoms) we will calculate.

For your convenience, we have pss in this directory; pss shows job
status.  "pss 1" shows working directory also.
(you can kill a background job (including child processes) by "pss -KILL jobid").

--
  >make_job --bg --continue
gives job files (jobque and jobscript in TEST.bg or so on) to restart
calculations. These jobscript are to look into the end of save file to
restart calculations.

The followings describe what make_jobque.bg does.
===================================================
1. Setup1. 
  >cp jobquescript.py jobmoldimer1.py * ~/bin 
  >cp savedata pldimer1 plmol.py ~/bin/   !these are utilities (data
  gathered, and plot tool) after calculation are finished.
  I assumed you have ~/bin directory in $PATH.

  >cp pss ~/bin  (pss is  a utility explained already)

  Important files to set computational conditions are
    jobquescript.py:  jobque and job file generator.
    jobmoldimer1.py:  ctrl file generator for dimers.
    jobdimerlist.15:  specify dimers for which, we will generate job files.

2. Setup2.
    Make working directory <work dir>. 
    >cp jobdimerlist.15 extra.bash homedimerdistance.bash <work dir>
    <work dir> is TEST.bg in the case the make_jobque.bg

3. Run 
   jobquescript.py internally calls jobmoldimer1.py (or jobatom1.py)

The main purpose of make_jobque.bg is to generate required ctrl files,
directories, job files to perform TEST.bg/jobque.
Look into jobque.

You can use jobdimerlist.10 instead of jobdimerlist.test. (or jobdimerlist.15).
jobdimerlist.10 (for all dimers) requires 24 hours with 96 core machine.
jobdiemrlist.15 requires one week; it looks too long 
(we have room to make it efficient ...).
=======================================================



After make_jobque.bg is finished, you can find
  jobmoldimer1_-0.20,_fsmom=0@_rstar=0.8@__H_H2dis_alatpath15
in Test.bg/. This is the main script to run a job for 
  magnetic mom=0; distance=-0.2+gaussian value; MT size=0.8*gaussian
value; supercell size is embedded in alatpath variable .
This corresponds the setting in jobdimerlist.15
  distance=0.1;0.1@  fsmom=2@ rstar=0.9@ $O $O2dis $alatpath15
. If you change $alatpath15 to $alatpath10, it mean 10 angstrome cell 
(exactly speaking, not cubic cell, but a deformed cell to break symmetry).

---
PWE control:
Initial condition is calculated with bzw=0.01 with pwe=2. Then we use bzw=0.00001
for main part of calculations. 


=== Plot ===
To gather data and plot them, perform 'savedata' command (at /TEST.bg or so on ).

>savedata <2Sz> <Z>
For example
>savedata 0 1
for H_2.
This gives a picture of gnuplot.
Data for plot is in datg.savedata.0.1.
(In cases savedatax works OK; this takes even unconverged cases).
