Samples are mainly at ecalj/MATERIALS/

1. At ~/ecalj/MATERIALS/, run ./job_materials.py
  It shows a help with a list of materials.
  It contains samples of simple materials.
  It performs LDA calculations and generates GWinput for materials.

2. ecalj deguchi paper 
   https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.7567/JJAP.55.051201
   All calculation is by the default setting in QSGW on the PMT method.
   No empty spheres. EH=-1,EH=-2, MT radius is -3% untouching.
   RSMH=RSMH2=R/2

3. As for the setting of 4f,5f atoms, not yet automatic.
   See setting ecalj/Document/HowToSet4f_GdQSGW4.pdf.

4. Maximally localized Wannier function and cRPA interaction
   ~/ecalj/MATERIALS/Sample_MLWF

5.  (for magnon branch under developing),
    ecalj/MATERIALS/Fe_magnon, Ni_magnon, NiMnSb_magnon
    
    See magnon_all.sh. Run it.
    It performs LDA calculaiton, band plot, genMLWF_wv (wannier and
    W), epsPP_magnon_chipm_mpi (magnon calculation), successively.

6. TETRAHEDRON_HomoGas
    To use tetrahedron method for dielectric funciton. electron gas.

7. mass_fit_test
    Get effective mass

8. MgO_PROCAR
   PROCAR mode. Fat band sample.
