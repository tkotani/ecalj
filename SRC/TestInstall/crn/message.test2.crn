         The CrN test case generates core-level spectroscopy for the
         1s state in N.  The self-consistent calculation proceeds with
         an electron missing from the N 1s core, which corresponds to
         the 'sudden approximation' (system relaxes instantanously
         from electron exited out of hole).
