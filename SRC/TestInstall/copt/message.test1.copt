         The copt test also checks and illustrates the following:

         1.  a spin-polarized case

         2.  Sampling with Fermi function at fairly high temperature (5mRy)

         3.  forces with correction mode 12 (FORCES=12)

         4.  two-kappa basis, with second kappa consisting of Co p only

	 5.  inequivalent kmxa,lmxa,rmt
