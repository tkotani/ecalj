* impact ionization rate calculation.

At first, we need ground state where we have accurate band gap.
For this, we use hybrid QSGW (Deguchi,10.7567/JJAP.55.051201), 20 percent LDA included.
Then we run one-show GW calculations where we calcualte self-energy with dense k point mesh.

** Step 0.
Install ecalj. See ecaljdoc https://ecalj.github.io/ecaljdoc/

** Step 1.
Create C/ directory, while keep original C/ in the ecalj package somewhere. This is for diamond.
Prepare crystal structure file ctrls.c file. Here .c is an extension for diamond.
This contains only the crystal structure. 
We can get it via conversion to VASP POSCAR format (thus cif=>POSCAR=>ctrl).
or by hand.
---- ctrls.c --------------
%const bohr=0.529177 a= 3.56683/bohr
STRUC
     ALAT={a} 
     PLAT=0 0.5 0.5  0.5 0 0.5  0.5 0.5 0 
SITE
     ATOM=C POS=0.0 0.0 0.0
     ATOM=C POS=0.25 0.25 0.25
-------------------------

** Step 2. LDA band calculation
See https://ecalj.github.io/ecaljdoc/

Convert this to ctrl.c by
>ctrlgenM1.py c
>cp ctrlgenM1.ctrl.c ctrl.c
The ctrl.c is the input file for band structure calculation.
We may/may not modify only nspin, nk1,nk2,nk3(# of k point) usually.
Now not need to modify them.

Then we run
>lmfa
, which is to generate spherical atom data for band structure calculation.
atm* atmpnu* are used in the followings.
>mpirun -np 4 lmf c
Main part of band calculation. save.c show info for iteration summary.
>getsyml c
(currently, showing BZ may not work. But stop it and have syml.c for symmetry line of BZ).
>job_band c -np 4
At this point, we should have band structure plot correctly in LDA.


** Step 3. QSGW band calculation
https://ecalj.github.io/ecaljdoc/
Set ssig=0.8 in ctrl.c file. This is QSGW80(20 percent of LDA xc term included).
(ssig do not affect to LDA calculation. So, we can set this in advance).
>mkGWinput c
This quickly generates GWinput.tmp for GW kinds of calculations.
>cp GWinput.tmp GWinput
Then we may modify some point in GWinput. Now we use it without modification.
   Run QSGW calcualtion by
>gwsc 5 -np 32 c >& out
5 means five QSGW iteration. So, 0th to 4th. Most expensive part
(If you run this gain, it continue 5th run (because gwsc checks 'QPU.4run' exists).
 QPU is the file for self-energy infomation (only real part in gwsc mode). 
gwsc is timeconsuming for generating self-energy=(XC part), 
so use batch job (qsub file for my system is C/job).
   Anyway, bandplot in QSGW is in the same manner as LDA;
>job_band c -np 4
We have band plot in QSGW. 
Note that one of unique point in our QSGW code is that
number of k point for omega-independent sel-energy 
(=XC_QSGW, which is expensive part---this is Screened-exchange-like term).

sigm.c contains XC_QSGW-XC_LDA term. rst.c contains electron density.
We need to keep atmpnu* (logarismic derivative at Muffin-tin boundary).
In cases NTQXX causes a problem (when you change setting of comutational condition), then delete NTQXX 
(number of bands for which we calcuate XC_QSGW).


** Step 4. QPE_life energy
Let us make another directory as C121212GW/.
From C/, copy GWinput, ctrl.c, rst.c, sigm.c, atmpnu.*.c to C121212GW/.
(At C1212GW/, we can run >mpirun -np 4 lmf c to reproduce final results).
All XC_QSGW is in sigm.c.

Then edit GWinput file for GW calculation for diagonal elements only but including imaginary part.
We set 
1. 12 12 12 k points.
2. lcutmx =2 for atoms (light atoms) to have computational time. This sets somehow automatic.

xxx 3. number of bands at which we calculate self-energy in <QPNT> section. Our example is
xxx   for 12 bands from index 1 to index 12.

3. Set EMAXforGW
(2025-08-08. I think GWinput need to be modified because <QPNT> did not work.
Instead, I think we need to set
---
EMAXforGW 30 !eV
---
in GWinput

Take
>diff C/GWinput C121212GW/GWinput
to know how to modify GWinput.

Main job is run by gw_lmfh by gw_lmfh. An example of qsub script is
----------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
#$ -N mp
#$ -pe smp 16
#$ -cwd
#$ -M takaokotani@gmail.com
#$ -m be
#$ -V
#$ -S /bin/bash
n=$0
nfpgw=`pwd`
mat=${nfpgw##*/}
mat='c'
echo $mat
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
EXEPATH=/home/takao/bin/
$EXEPATH/gw_lmfh -np 16 $mat >& out
----------------------------------
Then we finally get QPU file.
QPU contains human-readable self-energy information.
In the default setting, it took ~200 min in our machine.

>cleargw . 
clean up too much files below the current directory.

** Comparison with Old result
>gnuplot -p imi_compare.glt

We see a little differnce from 'old calculaiton'. Reasons are
1. Some changes of code and minor changes of ecalj method.
2. We set ssig=0.68 so as to set the band gap=5.47eV in old result.
3. I didn't check it well (sorry), but I may use lcutmx 4 4 for OldResult.

At OldResult/,
>gnuplot -p imi_dia.glt
This shows dependence on number of k points. Looks not so bad.
