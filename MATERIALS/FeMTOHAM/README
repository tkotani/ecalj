Please look into job_ham

After you have finished self-consistent calculation (LDA,QSGW),
do the same procedure in job_ham (look into job_ham first).

You can get Hamiltonian and Ovealap matrix for MTOs. 
It is in the file HamiltonianMTO.
This is without APWs. (we set pwmode=0 in ctrl.fe in job_ham)
Use the efermi.lmf for the fermi energy.


lmfham is given in lm7K/lmfham.F
This reads HamiltonianMTO and diagonalize it.
( this is an exmple of module based coding I recommend.
  Right after " call readHamiltonianMTO() ", we have all required
  things allocated in the main routine of lmfham.)
For test purpose,  search eigen111 and eigen222 in lmfham.F.
Both gives the same eigenvalues.
