         The co test also checks and illustrates the following:

         1.  a spin-polarized case

         2.  tetrahedron method (METAL=3)

         3.  Constrained mixing (first spin is kept frozen, then charge, then both are allowed to change)

         4.  Broyden mixing

         5.  bands mode (see command-line argument --band in last lmf invocation)
             SO coupling and color weights for projection onto Co d channels are included.
             Two separate weights are made (one each for d majority and minority bands.)
             This script will prompt you to see whether it should create 
             a figure from the bands file (The fplot plotting package needs
             to be installed for this function).
