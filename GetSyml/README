Get symmetry line. syml.* from ctrl.*

In this directory, we have getsyml.py, which is based on the
seekpath(v.1.2.0, dec2016). https://github.com/giovannipizzi/seekpath/


===========================
Requirement and Install:

0.
python2.7 and standard tools
We need python 2.7 or higher (probably), not 3.x.
(you may like to install it locally. 
 See https://my.justhost.com/hosting/help/python-install).

In a case, we need to do
>wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
>python get-pip.py
>python -m pip install future --user
>python -m pip install matplotlib --user
>python -m pip install scipy --user
)
The option '--user' installs it locally.

1.
spglib for crystal structure symmetry
>git clone https://github.com/atztogo/spglib.git
>python setup.py install --user

2.
seekpath
>git clone https://github.com/giovannipizzi/seekpath/
>python setup.py install --user



===========================
Usage: (we use python2. We probably need some fixing for python3)

>python getsyml.py nio
>python getsyml.py ctrls.nio 
This show 3D Brillouin zone together with symmetry lines for band plot.
The symmetry lines are written into the syml.* file.
You can edit syml.* for bandplot by the job_band command.
The number of divisions for syml is give by simple algorism, so edit
it if necessary.


===========================
Citations when we use.
  In addition to usual ecalj acknowledgement, following citations are
  required when you make a publication.

   1.Y. Hinuma, G. Pizzi, Y. Kumagai, F. Oba, I. Tanaka, 
     Band structure diagram paths based on crystallography,
     Comp. Mat. Sci. 128, 140 (2017) 
   2.You should also cite spglib that is an essential library used in the implementation.

TODO:
   a.Modify lmchk to write required information to supply reasonable.
     For example, ndiv (mesh size along lines).
   b.Numerical accuracy of calculations. 
     np.set_printoptions(precision=16) is not meaningful since we read
     output of lmchk
