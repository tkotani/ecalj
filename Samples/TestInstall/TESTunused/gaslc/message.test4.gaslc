	 The GaAs test with local orbitals and GW self-energy computes 
	 the energy bands at (0,0,0) (Gamma point),(1/4,1/4,1/4) 
	 and (1/2,1/2,1/2) (L point).
	 The spin-orbit splitting of the valence states is tested.

         This test also checks SO coupling in conjunction with 
         extended local orbitals and floating orbitals.
