We can reproduce Ni_magnon and Fe_magnon
with
> testecalj Ni_magnon
> testecalj Fe_magnon
--------------------------

-------
We need
 GWinput
 ctrl.fe
 syml.fe
 wanplot.glt
 mag3d.glt
 fbplot.glt
 magnon_all.sh
to run ./magnon_all.sh, which calls genMLWF_wv and so on.

After finished, you will have magnon3d_100.eps and so on.
Compare them with eps/*.eps

-------
NOTE*2025-02-27
As for Ni, we need wan_in_emin -10 eV (instead of -5 eV) to avoid error
(error occured in init_iew
at echo 2 | /home/takao/bin/hmaxloc  > lmaxloc2 .
(Souza Eq.27 is implmented in init_iew. It failed in Ni. Why?)
)
magnon3d.eps was a little different from previous results.
But maybe difference of some settings.
