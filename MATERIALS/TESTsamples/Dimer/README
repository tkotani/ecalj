We have done homo nuclear dimers (and) atoms from H2 through Kr2.
It works well. However, to get accurate results, it is better 
to use larger basis set, because it requires small MTs.

Considering efficiency, current version of ctrlgen2.py uses
somehow smaller basis set for atoms (smaller number of EH,EH2 and less
number of local orbitals). For example, we set
"s,p,d + s,p" basis for Oxygen (three EH and two EH2) in current
version of ctrlgen2.py, however, "s,p,d,f" + "s,p,d" gives better
(lower) total energy.

In addition, for some atoms, we skip local oribtals.
This can cause core spliout problems: 
since we use frozen core approximation for cores,
rigid core charged added to total electron density can be too large. 
This can cause poor total energy.
In addition, without local orbitals with very small MT, 
we can have an instability of convergence because 
core-valence otrhogonality is not kept well.
