----------------------
We need
 GWinput
 ctrl.fe
 syml.fe
 wanplot.glt
 mag3d.glt
 fbplot.glt
to run ./magnon_all.sh, which calls genMLWF_wv and so on.

After finished, you will have magnon3d_100.eps and so on.
Compare them with eps/*.eps

As for Ni, we need wan_in_emin -10 eV (instead of -5 eV) to avoid error
in init_iew
at echo 2 | /home/takao/bin/hmaxloc  > lmaxloc2 .
(Souza Eq.27 is implmented in init_iew. It failed in Ni. Why?)
